# Store-Management-System

The store management system is used to represent store master data of various retailers. It offers the possibility to:

* Get an overview over all stores, including the filtering of stores by their mandatory data fields.
* Add, edit, and delete stores.
* Fetch information of a single store. In addition, the characteristics of a single store can be compared to the characteristics of all other stores.
*  Display an aggregated view of the characteristics over all stores.
*  Handle multiple users, including different access levels (i.e., admin and user).
